  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
  
  <p>How many fools can I kill today? </p>
  <p>Too many to count, don't get in my way.</p>
  <p>I shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow</p>
  <p>Tomohawk chop is my death blow </p>
  
  <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
  <p>Freedom fightin' machine, big-ass hatchet in hand </p>
  <p>Why'd you have to kill my bros? I'ma slash your face, man</p>
  <p>I'm a very skilled assassin killin' dudes in ones and twos</p>
  <p>Blood flowin' like a river, need a box of tissues </p>
  <p>When I'm huntin', I be stuntin', you can never find me </p>
  <p>In the bushes, in the hay stacks, in your mother's laundry </p>
  <p>Watch me comin', free runnin', up the walls like a boss</p>
  <p>What you lookin' at, bitch? Taste my tomahawk chop!</p>
  
  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
  <p>How many fools can I kill today? </p>
  <p>Too many to count, don't get in my way.</p>
  <p>I shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow</p>
  <p>Tomohawk chop is my death blow </p>

  <h3>[Break]</h3>
  <p>Tomahawk, Tomahawk </p>
  <p>T-T-Tomahawk, Tomahawk</p>
  <p>Tomahawk, Tomahawk </p>
  <p>T-T-Tomahawk, Tomahawk</p>
  
  <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
  <p>From Boston to NY, always up to no good</p>
  <p>Don't know how I can see out this big-ass hood </p>
  <p>Walkin' through the crowds, touchin' you on the back</p>
  <p>Using my hidden blade for a secret attack </p>
  <p>Jumpin' off of giant buildings like I was a super man</p>
  <p>Use your momma as a meat shield every time that I can</p>
  <p>Take a break from the war to hunt for some meat</p>
  <p>What? A man's gotta eat</p>
  
  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
  <p>How many fools can I kill today? </p>
  <p>Too many to count, don't get in my way.</p>
  <p>I shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow</p>
  <p>Tomohawk chop is my death blow </p>

  <h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
  <p>Up first in the verse, feel the clack of wooden teeth </p>
  <p>Bread and butter, lift the covers and you'll find the fuckin' heat.</p>
  <p>Re-revolution I lead with the world I got beef</p>
  <p>I dig my wigs powdered, wear boxers, I don't wear briefs </p>
  <p>You can't step up to me and my gang </p>
  <p>Horse and carriage, drive-bys, bullet in the chamb' </p>
  <p>Ridin' over your clique like the Delaware, son</p>
  <p>I'll get my face on that dollar before this shit's done</p>
  
  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
   <p>How many fools can I kill today? </p>
  <p>Too many to count, don't get in my way.</p>
  <p>I shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow</p>
  <p>Tomohawk chop is my death blow </p>
